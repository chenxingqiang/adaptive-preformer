# AdaptivePreFormer

AdaptivePreFormer is a novel end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes preprocessing and modeling for continuous sequence learning, particularly focused on EEG signal processing.

## Features

- Joint optimization of preprocessing and modeling
- Adaptive preprocessing based on signal quality
- Continuous position encoding for sequence modeling
- Efficient processing of long sequences
- Quality-aware attention mechanism

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chenxingqiang/adaptive-preformer.git
cd adaptive-preformer
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

1. Download and prepare the dataset:
```bash
python scripts/download_data.py
```

2. Train the model:
```bash
python scripts/train.py
```
